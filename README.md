Warning: This does not work(yet)! Insmodding kexec work, but loading a new kernel fails.
This repository contains some compiled stuff, and the sources to regenerate the compiled items.
The kernel in src is the patched kernel of the Boxee Box, it has some things(mainly kexec.c) patched to make kexec work.
I did not attach the meego source.
I will not work on this anymore, somebody please fork this and fix kexec.

Many thanks to cj_000 from GTVHacker for explaining many things and helping me getting kexec compiled.
